# Rex 2.0

This is the repository for development of Rex 2. 

The intention of this repository is to develop Rex 2 in the public, so that we can consider all the ideas and needs of the community.

Currently there is not much yet but it will be extended with ideas and example codes.

## STATE

This is currently work-in-progress. ATM there is no working code yet but we collect rfcs for the different parts of a configuration management and remote execution tool.

* [Client/Server](doc/rfc/client_server.md) - How the client/server model should be build.
* [Command Interface](doc/rfc/command.md) - The interface of the server-side component of rex.
