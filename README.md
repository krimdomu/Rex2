# Rex Ideas

These are some ideas which might be integrated in future rex releases.

## STATE

This is currently work-in-progress. ATM there is no working code yet but we collect rfcs for the different parts of a configuration management and remote execution tool.

## RFCs

Currently written RFCs and POCs.

* [Connection](doc/rfc/connection.md) - How the Connection with the remote host should be done.
* [Client/Server](doc/rfc/client_server.md) - How the client/server model should be build.
* [Command Interface](doc/rfc/command.md) - The interface of the server-side component of rex.
* [Resource](doc/rfc/resource.md) - How resources should work.
* [Function](doc/rfc/function.md) - How functions should work.
* [Inventory](doc/rfc/inventory.md) - How the inventory should work.
* [Rexfile](doc/rfc/rexfile.md) - Do i really need one?
